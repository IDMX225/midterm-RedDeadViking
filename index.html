            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nicholas Niva or Nick for short and I am currently a student at Raritan Valley Community College where I am studying Information Systems and Technology. The midterm for my Website Development and Design Class consisted of creating a website so I decided mine would be on something I love. One of the things I love most is Travel so I decided I would make a Travel Blog going through my experiences traveling all over the world. Below, take a look at some of the places I've been so far and some totally real reviews from some totally real people.</p>
